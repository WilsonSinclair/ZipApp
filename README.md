### Create stable Flutter channel

```
// set flutter to stable channel
flutter channel stable

// check flutter channel
flutter channel

// output
Flutter channels:
  master
  dev
  beta
* stable
```

### Flutter Version Management (FVM)

Ensure Flutter Version Management (FVM) is installed

`flutter pub global activate fvm`

`dart pub global activate fvm`
### Add FVM to Path

The installation above will give you a suggestion to add the flutter config file to your path. The message will look something like this:

```
Warning: Pub installs executables into /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/flutter/3.0.5/flutter/.pub-cache/bin, which is not on your path.
You can fix that by adding this to your shell's config file (.bashrc, .bash_profile, etc.):

  export PATH="$PATH":"/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/flutter/3.0.5/flutter/.pub-cache/bin"
```

### Install Flutter Version 1.22.5

`fvm install 1.22.5`

### Set Flutter Version to 1.22.5

`fvm use 1.22.5`
